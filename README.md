A fun school project

Delete me btw, this is for a "fun prank"


- Side note! Hey there who ever you are (if its not just me!), don't download any of these files. They may not harm your device but there's always the risk of it actually doing so.



##### oh and btw "nothingtoseehere" is just a useless depricated old file, use the new one for refrence (which is also the same code the .exe is running) "Win-Update-Patch.py"
